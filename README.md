Project Euler
=============

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." - taken from https://projecteuler.net/about.

My Solutions
============

This git repo is a collection of both my solutions and attempts on several dozen Project Euler problems, all written completely in C. Each file name is the identification for the problem it deals with. If you have any interest in doing Project Euler problems, please do not read my answers unless you have already solved that problem.

Install
=======

Each file can be compiled as follows:

gcc [file].c -o [file].o

Files that include math.h need to be compiled like this:

gcc [file].c -o [file].o -lm

History
=======

Several years ago I answered a similar number of problems in Python, which I was still relatively new to at the time. I've decided to repeat this by testing out my new C knowledge by doing as many Project Euler problems as I can! I feel like I've gone as far as I reasonably can with Project Euler in C now, so I will likely to be slow in continuing to update this repo.
